**Basic Heap Coding Questions:**

1. **Implement a Min-Heap:** Write code to create and maintain a binary min-heap.
2. **Implement a Max-Heap:** Write code to create and maintain a binary max-heap.
3. **Heapify an Array:** Given an array, convert it into a valid heap.

**Intermediate Heap Coding Questions:**

4. **Kth Largest Element in an Array:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
5. **Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:** Find the kth smallest element in a sorted matrix.
6. **Merge K Sorted Arrays:** Given K sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.
7. **Top K Frequent Elements:** Find the k most frequent elements in an array.

**Advanced Heap Coding Questions:**

8. **Heap Sort:** Implement the heap sort algorithm.
9. **Priority Queue Implementation:** Implement a priority queue using a binary heap.
10. **Find the Median of a Stream:** Design a data structure that supports the following two operations: addNum() and findMedian().
11. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a min-heap for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

**Challenging Heap Coding Questions:**

12. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays:** Find the median element of the two sorted arrays without actually merging them.
13. **Connect 'n' Ropes with Minimum Cost:** Given ‘n’ ropes with different lengths, connect them to minimize the cost.
14. **Merge K Sorted Linked Lists:** Merge K sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
15. **Sliding Window Maximum:** Given an array and an integer k, find the maximum element for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
