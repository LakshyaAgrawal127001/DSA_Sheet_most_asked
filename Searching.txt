**Basic Searching Coding Questions:**

1. **Linear Search:** Write a function to perform a linear search on an array to find a specific element.
2. **Binary Search:** Write a function to perform a binary search on a sorted array to find a specific element.
3. **Find Maximum Element:** Write a function to find the maximum element in an array (without sorting).
4. **Find Minimum Element:** Write a function to find the minimum element in an array (without sorting).
5. **Check if Element Exists:** Write a function to check if a given element exists in an array.

**Intermediate Searching Coding Questions:**

6. **Count Occurrences:** Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array.
7. **Find First and Last Occurrence:** Write a function to find the first and last occurrence of a specific element in a sorted array.
8. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array:** Given a rotated sorted array, write a function to find a specific element.
9. **Square Root of a Number:** Implement a function to find the square root of a given number using binary search.

**Advanced Searching Coding Questions:**

10. **Interpolation Search:** Implement the interpolation search algorithm to find a specific element in a sorted array.
11. **Exponential Search:** Implement the exponential search algorithm to find a specific element in a sorted, unbounded list.
12. **Two Pointers Technique:** Implement a solution using the two-pointers technique (e.g., finding pairs with a given sum).
13. **Search in 2D Matrix:** Given a 2D matrix sorted in ascending order, write a function to find a specific element.

**Challenging Searching Coding Questions:**

14. **Find Peak Element:** Given an array, find a peak element (an element which is greater than or equal to its neighbors).
15. **Median in a Sorted Array:** Find the median of two sorted arrays of the same size.
16. **Smallest Missing Positive Integer:** Given an unsorted array, find the smallest missing positive integer.
17. **Search in a Sorted and Rotated Array:** Given a rotated sorted array, write a function to find a specific element.
rithms and techniques. It's important to understand the time and space complexity of each algorithm and practice implementing them in your preferred programming language. Good luck!
