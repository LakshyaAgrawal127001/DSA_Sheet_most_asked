**Basic Priority Queue Coding Questions:**

1. **Implement a Priority Queue:** Write a class or data structure that implements a basic priority queue.
2. **Insert and Extract Maximum:** Implement functions to insert elements into the priority queue and extract the maximum element.
3. **Check if Priority Queue is Empty:** Write a function to check if a priority queue is empty.
4. **Find the Maximum Element in a Priority Queue:** Write a function to find the maximum element without extracting it.

**Intermediate Priority Queue Coding Questions:**
