**Basic DP Coding Questions:**

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Implement a function to find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
2. **Factorial:** Use dynamic programming to calculate the factorial of a number.
3. **Count Ways to Reach the Nth Stair:** Given that you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time, how many ways are there to reach the nth stair?
4. **Coin Change Problem:** Given a set of coins and a total amount, find the number of ways to make up that amount.
5. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.
6. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that elements are in strictly increasing order.

**Intermediate DP Coding Questions:**

7. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Given weights and values of items, find the maximum value that can be obtained in a knapsack of a fixed capacity.
8. **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply them.
9. **Edit Distance:** Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other.
10. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS):** Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that elements are the same in reverse order.
11. **Minimum Path Sum:** Given a grid, find the minimum sum path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, moving only right or down.
