**Basic Map Coding Questions:**

1. **Create a Map:** Write a program to create a map and add key-value pairs.
2. **Access Values:** Write a program to access the values of a map using keys.
3. **Check if Key Exists:** Write a program to check if a specific key exists in a map.
4. **Remove Key-Value Pair:** Write a program to remove a key-value pair from a map.
5. **Iterate Over Map:** Write a program to iterate over the keys and values of a map.

**Intermediate Map Coding Questions:**

6. **Frequency Count:** Given an array, write a program to create a map that counts the frequency of each element.
7. **Find Duplicates:** Write a program to find duplicate elements in an array using a map.
8. **Word Frequency Counter:** Write a program that takes a string and creates a map of word frequencies.
9. **Anagrams Grouping:** Given a list of strings, group anagrams together.
10. **Two Sum Problem:** Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

**Advanced Map Coding Questions:**
