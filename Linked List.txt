**Basic Linked List Coding Questions:**

1. **Create a Linked List:** Implement a basic linked list with nodes and the ability to add elements.
2. **Reverse a Linked List:** Write a function to reverse the elements of a linked list.
3. **Find the Middle of a Linked List:** Write a function to find the middle element of a linked list.
4. **Detect a Cycle in a Linked List:** Write a function to detect if a linked list contains a cycle.

**Intermediate Linked List Coding Questions:**

5. **Detect a Cycle's Starting Point:** If a cycle exists in a linked list, find the node where the cycle begins.
